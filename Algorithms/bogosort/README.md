Hi folks,

This algorithm is garbage. It's literally called "stupid sort". The way it works, is that you take an array and you shuffle it. Is it in order? If not, start over.

It's like throwing a deck of cards in the air. If it's not in completely perfect order, numbers and suits, you throw the deck again.

However I did learn this in my Data Structures and Algorithms class. So, today I bless you with the fantastic "Quantum Bogosort".
